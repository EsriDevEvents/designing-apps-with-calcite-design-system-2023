# Designing Apps with Calcite Design System

### Repository description
This repository contains an example application that illustrates the theming capabilities of the Calcite Design System's
Calcite Component web component library. To note:

- The default Calcite theme variables for both light and dark modes are overwritten with css.
- Calcite Chip components are programmatically themed to correspond to Feature layer symbol fill colors in the map.

### Session description
Calcite Design System provides developers with the tools, assets, and guidance needed to design and build exceptional
map-focused experiences across a variety of modalities. This session will focus on patterns and best practices for
designing apps with Calcite. You'll learn how Calcite can jump-start your designs, reduce future maintenance needs, and
alleviate the challenges of scaling design by leveraging framework-agnostic design tokens and web components. We'll
cover Calciteâ€™s documentation resources, demonstrate the capability of token-based theming, and explore the amazing
features and functionality of our newly built Figma UI kit.
